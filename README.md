# Stutern Assessment

This is a simple assessment as part of the Stutern selection process. It is a single-page personal profile using HTML and CSS. It uses semantic HTML tags and a mix of CSS Flexbox and Grid for the layout. The CSS is clean and well-organized using comments to indicate each section, and the profile is responsive.
